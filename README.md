# eventcountdown

An event countdown application created in Flutter, using only Future.delayed and NOT the Timer class at all.
- Used Provider for state management.
- Used DateTime to calculate time difference in seconds

## Future improvements

- Make the UI better on the first page
- Implement Event name in provider
- Handle past time errors (Although I may have done that unintentionally)
